    <h1>Element 1: Lab Work projects</h1>
    <h2>Lab1: fireWORKS</h2>
    <p>This has been one of the first introduction projects to vectors. In class we have been presented with a code that was meant to explain how forces are implemented on boids. 
        From that example I transformed the appearance of the boids as well as their interaction to create a complete new visual effect that would reassemble complex firework like patterns. 
        The visual outcome is a mesmerising display of colored dots moving across the screen, demonstrating complex, fluid motion that mimics fireworks. The background refreshes whenever a boid moves out of the visible canvas area,
        ensuring the simulation continuously runs smoothly and the patterns stay interesting. This code not only showcases the beauty of collective behaviour but also serves as an engaging example of applying mathematical rules and 
        object-oriented programming to create complex, emergent systems. </p>

    <h2>Lab2: Farm-slider</h2>
    <p>This code crafts an interactive experience by allowing users to dynamically alter a sentence through a slider control. Inspired by Barbara Kruger’s “Pledge, Will, Vow” installation at the Serpentine Gallery, 
        it features a striking red background, aligning with Kruger's aesthetic choices but utilises a different font. The piece presents well-known phrases with a twist. By substituting words with random animal names 
        the code aims to challenge the familiarity of these familiar expressions and reveal their absurdity. Future development to this code could include smarter word replacements for more contextually relevant absurdity 
        and an expanded vocabulary of nonsensical options, further highlighting the critique of normalised phrases and expression through word of mouth.</p>

    <h2>Lab3: coloredSignature_arduino</h2>
    <p>This code crafts a dynamic, evolving digital signature that visualises real-time data from a potentiometer connected to an Arduino. The cpode is inspired by “Computational Drawing” by Carl Lostritto. By manipulating vectors, 
        it transforms the physical act of turning a potentiometer into a unique, continuously changing digital signature on the canvas. The drawing evolves through a series of points that shift direction and speed according to the 
        Arduino's incoming data, effectively translating physical interactions into digital art. This project is fuelled by a nostalgic fascination with the uniqueness of signatures, aiming to create a personalised, code-generated, 
        colourful signature reminiscent of the childhood fascinations I had with signatures and finding my unique one. </p>
